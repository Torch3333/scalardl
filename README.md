## Scalar DL: Tamper-evident and Scalable Distributed Ledger

Scalar DL is a blockchain-inspired distributed ledger which achieves:
- High tamper-evidence of data by utilizing digital signature, hash chain, determinism and decentralization
- Scalable and highly available ACID-compliant smart contract executions
- Exact finality and linearizable consistency
